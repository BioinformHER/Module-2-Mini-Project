# BioinformHer Module 2 Mini Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the instructions and resources for the Module 2 Mini Project of the BioinformHer training program.

Participants are tasked with exploring the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across different species using basic bioinformatics tools. This capstone project allows students to apply all the skills learned in Module 2.

## Learning Objectives
- Perform sequence retrieval using BLAST
- Conduct pairwise and multiple sequence alignments
- Generate sequence logos to visualize conservation
- Construct phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary relationships
- Practice documenting and presenting scientific findings

## Tools & Platforms
Participants are expected to use freely available tools such as:
- NCBI BLAST
- Clustal Omega / MUSCLE
- Skylign
- MEGA X

## Project Tasks
1. Sequence Retrieval & BLAST Search  
2. Pairwise Sequence Alignment  
3. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)  
4. Sequence Logo Generation  
5. Phylogenetic Tree Construction  

All task descriptions are detailed in the project PDF.

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a report documenting each task, including screenshots and clear explanations.
- Name your file: HBB_MiniProject_YourFullName.pdf
- Create a public GitHub repository and push your report to it.
- Include a `README.md` describing the project.
- Submit the link to your GitHub public repository via the official Google Form.  
  Only submissions via the form will be considered for the Top 40 selection.

## Scholarship Selection
The top 40 participants will be selected based on:
1 Completeness
2 Clarity
3 Accuracy
4 Effort
4 Presentation
